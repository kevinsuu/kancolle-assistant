KanColle Assistant is a minimal, tabbed web browser for playing Kantai Collection, with integrated
KC3Kai and KCCacheProxy support.

This project is a modified fork of [planetarian/damecon-browser](https://github.com/planetarian/damecon-browser).<br>
The original Damecon project is built on Samuel Maddock's [electron-browser-shell](https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell).

## Release status

| App version | README updated |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| `v1.0.28`   | `2026-09-29`   |

- **Downloads:** Installers and portable archives are available from
  [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kevinsuu/kancolle-assistant/releases).
- **Per-version changes:** The
  [latest release notes](https://github.com/kevinsuu/kancolle-assistant/releases/latest) contain the
  generated update log between tags.
- **Cumulative capabilities:** [Feature status](#feature-status) shows what the current source
  supports, what may be added later, and what is out of scope.
- **Technical details:** The project-specific highlights below link to the relevant documents.

### v1.0.28 highlights (since v1.0.27)

- Master Ship remodel tooltips now supplement incomplete KC3Kai data for Kitakami Kai San, including Arsenal Resources, Development Materials, and Torches with their required quantities.

### v1.0.27 highlights (since v1.0.26)

- [Quest Recommendations](./docs/quest-recommendations.md) recovers from a failed manual sync by reading KC3's local data once, so usable quests appear without switching pages.
- Existing results remain available if recovery fails, with distinct sync, ranking, and data-load messages; fallback data is clearly marked as unconfirmed.

### v1.0.26 highlights (since v1.0.25)

- [Quest synchronization](./docs/quest-recommendations.md) now handles malformed server responses as retryable failures instead of uncaught main-process exceptions.
- Quest ranking runs in a separate background worker with a 30-second limit, preventing stalled ranking from blocking the main process and allowing retry.

### v1.0.25 highlights (since v1.0.24)

- The 5-4 guide now includes a fast battleship and carrier upper-route fleet with interchangeable fast battleships.
- All 5-4 routes treat air power as a recommended target while retaining required routing LoS; the fast battleship night route now shows its D-node maelstrom correctly.

### v1.0.24 highlights (since v1.0.23)

- Quest Recommendations lists each quest once by default; select **Combined** to see complete shared-action plans.
- The standard 6-1 carrier and submarine fleet now requires 126 air power for superiority at the boss node.

### Project-specific highlights

Compared with the original project, this source adds or improves:

1. **[Account access](./docs/dmm-local-login-storage.md)** — With confirmation, DMM credentials can be encrypted by the operating system's secure storage. An all-traffic mode for a trusted external forward proxy and clearer regional-error guidance are also included.
2. **[Adaptive game display](./docs/display-auto-fit.md)** — On startup, KC3 is fitted to its rendered content and the remaining display area determines the window and game-canvas scale; later resizing keeps the full game visible when possible without locking the window aspect ratio.
3. **[Normal-map fleet recommendations](./docs/fleet-recommender.md)** — In KC3 Strategy Room, select a sourced guide template for maps 1-1 through 7-5, including 5-6, and generate up to three account-owned fleets on demand without changing game state.
4. **[Ship recommendations](./docs/ship-recommendations.md)** — The Strategy Room **Ship Recommendations** page filters the NGA guide's 1–10 priority table to owned ship families that have not reached a listed guide remodel, uses canonical KC3 master data so language changes cannot alter matches, and shows each ship in a full-width row with its image, source strengths, priority rationale, and practical roles without changing game state.
5. **[Quest recommendations](./docs/quest-recommendations.md)** — The Strategy Room **任務推薦** page shows official Japanese quest titles, can manually synchronize current game status, filters individual quests by the fleet, sortie, exercise, expedition, arsenal, modernization, or other categories, and lists each quest once by default, showing complete shared-action groups when **Combined** is selected. It filters sortie quests with Chapters 1–7 enabled by default and ranks all open repeatable, normal one-time, and currently available time-limited quests using current and downstream rewards. Reward filters include a dedicated **Flight Deck Catapult** option. Time-limited quests appear under **Other** and are marked when KC3 does not provide their final deadline. Objective rules automatically derive compatible exercise and normal-map sortie stacks of up to five accepted quests; verified expedition and arsenal combinations remain supported, and non-sortie quests stay at the top regardless of chapter filters. Filter and sort settings are retained locally across page and game restarts. The visible quest list, complete conditions, and planning details can be exported as Markdown.
6. **[Expedition recommendations](./docs/expedition-resource-planner.md)** — The independent Strategy Room **遠征推薦** page shows current resources and uses adjustable resource and bucket weights, selected expeditions, success and Daihatsu settings, and fleets 2–4 to recommend one best pairing. Planning settings are retained locally across page and game restarts; the original Expedition Scorer remains unchanged and expeditions are never dispatched automatically.
7. **[Resource Center and ledger summary](./docs/resource-ledger-summary.md)** — The new KC3 Strategy Room **資源中心** dashboard shows current resources, gains, consumption, net change, hourly activity, source breakdowns, and consumables for today, yesterday, or the last 24 hours.
8. **[KC3 DevTools integration](./docs/kc3-devtools.md)** — The KC3 `KanColle` panel is moved forward and selected when game DevTools opens, reducing repeated manual navigation.
9. **[Strategy Room pinned links](./docs/strategy-room-recent-tabs.md)** — Pin any available Strategy Room tabs in `常用連結` with no fixed count limit; new pins appear first, existing links are retained, and ordinary navigation keeps their order unchanged.
10. **[Daily improvement filters](./docs/daily-improvement-filter.md)** — KC3's Daily Improvements page applies KC3's own improvable-equipment filter once by default and adds a horizontal filter containing only the equipment types currently available for improvement, while leaving the native toggle available for the complete list.
11. **[Master Ship remodel materials](./docs/master-ship-remodel-materials.md)** — Master Ship remodel tooltips list every special material with its icon, localized name, and required quantity.

These added Strategy Room interfaces follow KC3's selected language and support English,
Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese.

## ⚠️ Notice

#### KanColle Assistant is NOT intended to be used as a general-purpose browser.

KanColle Assistant is designed for one purpose only: playing KanColle.

KanColle Assistant is built upon Electron and lacks many security features found in major
browsers.

Seriously, I've literally never worked with Electron before. There's some real spaghetti-tier code going on here. Do you really wanna put your trust in that?

#### If you use KanColle Assistant for sensitive activities, you do so at your own risk.

## Usage

### From a Release build:

From the [Releases page](https://github.com/kevinsuu/kancolle-assistant/releases/latest), download
one of the following:

Installer: `kancolle-assistant-*.Setup.exe`

- Simply download and run it to install.
- This provides automatic updates for KanColle Assistant and is the simplest installation method.

Alternatively, use the ZIP file: `kancolle-assistant-*.zip`

- Download and extract its contents to an empty folder, then run `kancolle-assistant.exe`.
- This lets you use specific versions if desired, but lacks automatic updates.

### From source code, using `yarn`:

```bash
# Get the code
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kevinsuu/kancolle-assistant
cd kancolle-assistant

# Install and launch the browser
yarn
yarn start
```

### 🔌 Install extensions

Unpacked extensions inside `./extensions` will be loaded automatically.

- Supports both Manifest V2 and V3 extensions.
- Some/many plugins may not run properly (or at all) due to various extension APIs being unsupported.

There are a few plugins bundled with the Release builds for your convenience. It is safe to remove them if you wish (just delete from the `extensions` folder).

### ⚙️ Configure settings

On first launch, the settings page will open.

It will automatically begin downloading the latest Release version of KC3Kai, and upon completion, the KC3 start page will open.

You can access the KanColle Assistant settings at any time by clicking the app icon at the
top-left corner of the window.

### KC3Kai Update Configuration

The KC3Kai section in the settings page allows you to configure how KC3 is updated.

You can select from three different update channels: `release`, `master`, and `develop`.

- It is recommended to remain on the `release` channel, for the most stable experience.
- `master` and `develop` contain code actively in development, and may be unstable.
  - If using one of these two channels, the initial update may take several minutes to complete.
- Different channels are stored independently and have their own separate profiles.
  - You can switch between channels at any time, and those channels won't need to be re-downloaded.
  - Switching channels will automatically unload the old channel's extension and load the new one in.
  - To remove the files for a channel, simply delete the associated `kc3kai-*` folder within `./extensions`.

### Proxy Configuration

KanColle Assistant integrates with KCCacheProxy, so extensions such as ProxySwitchy are no longer
necessary.

You can configure your KCCP host/port in the `Proxy` section of the settings page.

The `Enabled` checkbox will enable/disable routing KanColle traffic through the proxy.

`KCCP internal` and `KCCP external` only proxy KanColle game-server traffic. They do not change
the public IP used for DMM login and region checks. To use an authorized HTTP/HTTPS forward proxy
for all browser traffic, select `all-external`, enter its host and forward-proxy port, and then
enable proxying. KanColle Assistant reapplies the proxy, closes pooled connections, and retries a DMM page
that was redirected to the regional-access error.

KanColle Assistant does not include or discover public proxies. Do not send DMM credentials through an
untrusted proxy. If DMM displays its regional-access page while you are already on a supported
network, disable unintended VPN, proxy, or private-relay software and retry.
